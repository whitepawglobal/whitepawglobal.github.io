Note Both companies are in the field of data science realm, which many people acknowledge as a still-evolving industry. Being in the fast-paced technology field, changes are the norm, and embracing changes is the only way in moving forward.
With a year of milestones after the transition, this article details the learning from the transition.</description></item><item><title>Speech-to-Text Demo Trained on Conversational Speech</title><link>/speech-to-text-demo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Chiawei Lim</author><guid>/speech-to-text-demo/</guid><description>Huggingface Space Quick Demo of speech-to-text model trained with wav2vec2-conformer

1 Introduction Itâ€™s no secret that Jupyter Notebook is the go-to IDE in the data science field. The cell nature of Jupyter allows instant running of a block of code snippet and manifest of the output.
Photo by the author It works seamlessly well with the nature of data analysis operation, specifically in the way where the subsequent lines of code highly depend on the scrutinization of the current cell output.</description></item></channel></rss>
